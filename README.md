# BallWorld
BallWorld is a simple Java application that depicts one bouncing 2D ball. The player may click on the environment the ball is rolling in, and the further the mouse cursor is from the ball while clicking, the faster the ball becomes. I made this app in March or April 2012 and I used Java.Swing for the graphics, the colors, and the animation. Ball World (which features only one ball) is not to be confused with Ball World Evolution (which features four balls).
